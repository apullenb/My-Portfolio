After years of working with small businesses and startups, I decided to narrow my focus and concentrate on coding and development, so I completed an intense training program to expand my programming skills. I am internally motivated and always eager to learn or improve. I look forward to joining a team to create and collaborate with other developers.`,
    description2: `My love of coding began when I was a kid and my dad bought a computer with a DOS operating system and we spent hours working with it together. In high school, I signed up for every web development course that was offered, and have been doing web design both professionally and as a hobby ever since.`,
    description3: `When I am not coding or planning my next project, you can find me spending time with my kids who share my love of all things retro. On the weekends, we enjoy sifting through thrift stores or antique shops looking for rare finds.`,
